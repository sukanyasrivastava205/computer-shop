DiUS is starting a computer store. You have been engaged to build the checkout system. We will start with the following products in our catalogue

SKU	Name	Price
ipd	Super iPad	$549.99
mbp	MacBook Pro	$1399.99
atv	Apple TV	$109.50
vga	VGA adapter $30.00

As we're launching our new computer store, we would like to have a few opening day specials.

1.We're going to have a 3 for 2 deal on Apple TVs. For example, if you buy 3 Apple TVs, you will pay the price of 2 only
2.The brand new Super iPad will have a bulk discounted applied, where the price will drop to $499.99 each, if someone buys more than 4
3.We will bundle in a free VGA adapter free of charge with every MacBook Pro sold.

POINTS TO BE NOTED:

The solution has been implemented using Java.
The entry point of the solution is in Checkout.java
The test cases are contained in DiscountDealsTest.java

Assumptions-
As there is no GUI I have built the solution by giving an entry point via main method in Checkout.java
To test in the application you can modify the main method accordingly.
The test cases also cover the various scenarios.
